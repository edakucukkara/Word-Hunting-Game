##### Algorithm in Python
- The words.txt file has the words which is using in the game. Firstly, game asks for starting to the player. If game is started it asks for the game mode ( game has two game mode: 1 word mode and 4 word mode), player should write game mode or if player wants to exit, should write 0. If game continiues, player should write the letter number to predict (there is three option 4, 5 or 6 lettered word). Then if the game continiues player shoul predict the words (player should write the letters one by one), there are limited prediction rights. End of every prediction there is a feed-back of which letter is true (green colored letter), misplaced (yellow colored letter) or false (red colored letter). When your predictions over it gives the true words and your predictions from last to first.
